        <h2>What Do the Scriptures Tell Us About the Comforting Power of Music?</h2>

<p>I m presuming that lots of you, on your own lives, have undergone the power of audio like me. Music has a method of reaching parts of us and touching the spirit. Unfortunately, I understand quite well what it feels like to be overcome by stress (sometimes apparently for no reason) it will become hard to breathe along with your heart begins to race. I understand what it feels like to be so concerned concerning this difficulty breathing which you end up on the brink of passing out. Stress is overpowering, and sometimes it can cause you to feel absolutely helpless, but my stone in the storm of stress and anxiety is the understanding that I'm a daughter of God, and He's in control. I've discovered that music has a fantastic calming effect on my spirit, and sacred music particularly has been my recovery balm again and again when weighed down with hard trials. Psalms 77 is a chapter which describes the distress which we believe occasionally in our lives, but in addition, it teaches us concerning relaxation and the peace we could see in the Lord. 1 suggestion in particular talks about opting to look for solace. Psalms 77:6 states,&amp;quot;I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.&amp;quot;  This psalmist understood when consumed by anxiety and stress, there's in turning into tune power. I hope that these songs which have been a blessing in my entire life, will function as tender mercies and blessings on your life. Only a side note, I understand that medication is a requirement for curing nervousness do 't judge yourself whether it requires over a tune or two. That said I really do think these tunes can help raise your mood (at least a small bit) regardless of what the circumstance, so that I hope you like them.  Into the tunes, I ' ve added links for your benefit, so that you can listen to them and determine which ones talk to a heart the most.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #1: Only Be Held</h2>

<p>Perhaps you have experienced one of these times when it feels as though your world is falling apart around you? &amp;quot;Only Be Held&amp;quot; is ideal for those minutes. One of my favourite lines from this song states,&amp;quot;your entire world 's falling apart; it's falling right into place.&amp;quot; Imagine if we embraced that standpoint in our daily lives? Regardless of what we re moving through, the experience is a good illustration of the world. Not falling apart at the seams. I don't know about you, but for me personally that idea requires a great deal of stress from any position. The song goes on to state,&amp;quot;cease holding, and be held.&amp;quot; We feel re holding on and it s not enough. It is more powerful to let go and allow our Heavenly Father hold us.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #2: Be Still My Soul</h2>

<p>&amp;quot;Be Still My Soul&amp;quot; is a strong hymn that rolls me levels. Without the words, the chords in this song are moving, although the words are amazing and reassuring.  I remember falling in love with this hymn one Sunday because we staged it and a couple of chords of this tune gave me goose bumps. I had been in my early teens also this hymn became one of my favorites. I love all of hymns, but this one is something. Listen to it, and also you 'll understand exactly what I m referring to. This tune will bring from calmness and the stillness which you yearn for if your spirit feels restless.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #3: Exhale</h2>

<p>Irregular breathing and tightness in the chest are a few of the most frequent signs of stress. Trust me, I've experienced lots of both.  Maybe you have noticed that when you're in a position you breathe shallowly or even hold your breath not breathing?  In case you've, don ' t worry. You re not the only one. I love the way the song&amp;quot;Exhale&amp;quot; informs us to breathe in elegance and exhale. We're not supposed to live life holding our breath. What a fantastic reminder that we're here in order to talk about the joys and love that's been offered to us. Give a listen to this song, and I am aware that will calm your heart.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #4: Breathe</h2>

<p>Have you been noticing a trend?&amp;quot;&amp;#160;Breathe&amp;quot; is just another fantastic tune that reminds us to slow down, take some time to breathe, and put our cares in the feet of the Savior.  Alma 7:11 says,&amp;quot;And he will go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every sort; and this that the word may be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.&amp;quot;  Our Savior has everything that we'll ever endure. Since he s experienced them holding to our worries doesn ' t take them away from him and it doesn't make us matters.  We breathe easily knowing that we're not those in charge and may also hand our burdens of stress over to our Savior.  We're not supposed to carry our burdens. This 's our loving Heavenly Father gave us his beloved son, Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #5: Where Can I Turn for Peace?</h2>

<p>I loved the hymn,&amp;quot;Where Can I Turn For Peace,&amp;quot; and once I heard the history story about why it had been composed, it became much more precious to my heart.  Two girls who collaborated on it wrote this tune. Had a girl who struggled with eating disorders and suffered from a mental illness.  Coincidentally, Joleen G. Meredith, who composed the music for this hymn endured from the exact same psychological illness as Thayne's kid. The 2 girls heralded this hymn,&amp;quot;the psychological illness tune.&amp;quot;  Since she saw her daughter move through those trials while, the time interval this was being composed could have been trying, she had been at peace, since she knew where to turn for sympathy.  We all feel mentally, emotionally, or spiritually broken from time to time, also this is a tune for all those times when you're currently looking for just a bit of hope and light in the end of the tunnel.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #6: Sparrows</h2>

<p>I love the tune&amp;quot;Sparrows,&amp;quot; since it's positive and contains great advice. I have a propensity to overthink and fret about everything. Worrying is draining, and joy is stolen by it from lots of adventures.  This tune reminds me isn'will help anything which I don't need to&amp;quot;worry my life away.&amp;quot; In the end,&amp;quot;the sparrow knows&amp;quot; better than to waste a perfectly fine life off by fretting about everything which may potentially occur.  This song describes Matthew 10:28-31 which speaks about how sparrows that are precious are into the Lord and just how much we are in contrast. Since the Lord is keeping tabs on every hair of our minds, it informs us that we don ' t have to worry.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #7: Take the Lillies </h2>

<p>&amp;quot;Consider the Lilies&amp;quot; is another tune which I fell in love with all the very first time that I discovered it only because the audio was really calming and talked to my heart. After I paid attention to the lyrics, I loved it more. The message is along the very same lines as the concept of&amp;quot;Sparrows.&amp;quot; The lilies don't fret about what they re going to look like how they re likely to grow. Their lily lives simply reside.  Just how much pleasure and peace could we get from our own lives if rather than fretting about what ' s likely to happen from day to day, we opted to live them. Imagine if we supposing that God has our very best interest in mind and had been with all the punches swinging like the lilies|had been with all the punches swinging like the lilies and supposing that God has our very best interest in mind|supposing that God has our very best interest in mind and had been like the lilies interfering with all punches?</p>

<h2>Calming Song #8: The Lord Is My Shepherd</h2>

<p>I &amp;quot;The Lord is My Shepherd&amp;quot; was a pretty tune, but it wasn't before I sang it to get my own voice lessons and took some time to actually look closely at the words and meaning behind it found a tender place in my heart. The symbolism in this tune is amazing. We're the sheep, and Christ is the shepherd. He requires us and provides for our needs. That having been said heard the expression that the grass is always greener on the other side of this fence. We simply have to trust that we are even though it feels like we're sitting at the center of a patch. The Lord is our shepherd, and we will be led by him into the greatest scenario for us.</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #9: Thy Will Be Done</h2>

<p>This may sound kind of odd, but&amp;quot;Thy Will Be Done&amp;quot; is among my preferred soothing tunes, but at a raw painful sort of way.  This tune has made me cry, a lot of occasions, but occasionally when we'feel frustrated and overwhelmed, it's there'so a great deal of emotion constructed inside that only has to be published, and yelling could be the perfect medicine.  This song is ideal for those occasions, since it s true, it s uncooked, and it s true. It s precisely what I want to hear when I want to allow my feelings flow. It will help me provide my burdens, and to open up about I m sense to my Heavenly Father. After all Doctrine Covenants 25: 12 says,&amp;quot;the tune of the heart is a prayer unto the Lord.&amp;quot;  Crying through this tune has helped a great deal of anxiety to alleviate, but I hear the humbling truths within this tune, and it calms my heart.  Like Hilary Scott states this song (that's all about her experience with a miscarriage by the way),&amp;quot;occasionally I've made ta cease, do not forget that you're God, and I am not.&amp;quot;</p>

<h2>Comforting Song #10: Amazing Grace (My Chains Are )</h2>

<p>What could I say which you simply don 't know?&amp;#160;Amazing Grace is a classic, and this specific variant is so strong it touches my heart in a particular way whenever I hear it. It s another one which is soul calming for me and absolutely. There are a whole lot of various types of chains which may bind us and for me personally stress is just one of these chains that are powerful which I wish to be free from.  I m that as I flip my life more completely over to my Savior, he could take those chains that bind me. I could be happy and carefree knowing that my Savior is really on my side and everything will work out in the long run.</p>
